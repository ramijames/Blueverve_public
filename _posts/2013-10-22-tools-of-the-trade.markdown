#We use a lot of online tools to make managing projects easier

##Making sure we're all on the same page is top-priority numbero uno.

Here at Blue Verve, I encounter many types of clients and with them many varying expectations about how a project should be run. People's experience runs the gamut. Some are hyper-organized, some are not. Some are hands on and some are absent (but interested)!

I'd like to talk a bit about what project management is for us, and which online tools we use and why. It's not sexy, but it is part of what makes a project succeed and *that* is.

##What tools make for smooth project management

###Working as a team

For basic project management we use <a href="http://www.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>. While not as feature-rich as we would like, it has the features we absolutely need and an interface which is simple enough that clients don't get frustrated while using it.

For our eagle-eye view of all our projects and resources, I use <a href="http://www.teamgannt.com">Team Gannt</a>. This allows me to make sure we don't overbook and that everyone can see where everyone else is in their projects.

###Communication and Visual Sharing

We are spread our all over the globe and constantly traveling. It's a facet of the modern world that we are all always accessible, almost always. Our core communication tool is, of course, <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>. We do online meetings, keep up to date, and solve problems together from anywhere.

There is <a href="http://www.google.com">Google Apps</a> for email and calendaring.

From time to time, we do problem-solving or presentations using <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com">Team Viewer</a>. It's free, works well, and doesn't crash. Awesome!

###Resources and code

The <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google</a> suite of tools, from docs to drive, is really an amazing way to share and concurrently work on concepts together. The comments feature alone in google docs has changed the way we work together.

For our big files, we use <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> as a repository. The 100Gb option is a budget-conscious solution for small teams. For larger space needs, you can get a terabyte or more. The built-in version control has saved our asses more than once. My biggest gripe with Dropbox is that it currently isn't possible to have granular control over sharing options. If you share a directory, all files and sub-directories will also be shared in the same way. This means that you can't share a "Work" directory and then share a single project directory inside it with someone else. It's a bit of a bummer.

For our sourcecode, we rely on <a href="http://www.bitbucket.com">Bitbucket</a> for git and version control on a remote server.

###Ideation and Discovery

A personal favorite of mine is <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> for note-taking and general saving of snippets and ideas. There is just so much information online today that it is difficult to keep track of every link, every idea, and every tidbit. I really love how flexible evernote is.

###Tracking bugs, telling stories

For our bug-tracking and scenario development needs, we use <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/JIRA">JIRA</a>. The interface isn't great or pretty, but it is one hell of a work-horse!

###Tracking hours

We use <a href="http://www.harvestapp.com">Harvest</a> for tracking hours. It's ubiquitous interface gets out of your way, while being ever persistant on iPhone, mac, windows, and web. 

#To each, his own

##So what does it all mean?

There are literally dozens of project management tools on the market and what it really comes down to in the end is finding what is comfortable for you and your team. We like our set up, and it works for us. Is it perfect? No. But, really, what is? We're always on the lookout for new ways to work more efficiently and as the market matures, the tools get better and better.
